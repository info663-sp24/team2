She unequivocally transformed the field when, in 1988, she took over the Department of Home Economics and Nutrition at New York University, and soon turned it into a ground-breaking academic program in nutrition, food studies, and public health. Her path traces a childhood without much parental encouragement, academic successes and multiple degrees, a pre-second wave feminism early career filled with the common restrictions and frustrations women then faced, and an adulthood at the highest rank of academic and personal achievement. A much sought-after speaker with particular interests in food politics, food marketing, and nutrition, she has written five books, and balances a schedule that includes teaching; research and writing; speaking; and an active highly-read blog (www.foodpolitics.com). This interview covers her early life and education; her two marriages; the challenges of balancing motherhood and a career; the responsibilities and challenges she faced writing the 1988 Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health; her books; her years at New York University; and the development of the University's Food Studies Department.","American Dietetic Association; Brandeis University; Dames d'Escoffier of New York; Fales Library; Monsanto Agricultural Company; New York University; Newsweek, inc.; University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco; University of California, Berkeley; United States.

Along with that and the attention to the profession given by the media, a new category has emerged—the Celebrity Chef. No one of them is better-known than Tom Colicchio. Already a highly respected and well-reviewed chef and restaurateur when he became the head judge of the wildly popular television program Top Chef, Colicchio is probably the best-known chef in America. As a young teenager, he started cooking at home, discovered he enjoyed it and worked his way through a swim club food concession, a Burger King, and increasingly more ambitious restaurants in his native New Jersey before heading to Manhattan. His teachers were his on-the-jobs training, the chefs he worked for there and in New York and books, especially Jacques Pepin's on method and technique. He came to wide attention at the Gramercy Tavern in New York's Flatiron district, and then at Craft nearby. The recipient of five James Beard Foundation awards, today Colichio and his cooking can be seen not only at the Craft restaurants (including Craftbar and Craftsteak) in New York, LA, Dallas, and Las Vegas), but also at Colicchio and Sons in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. In 2003, Colicchio and two partners founded the more affordable sandwich and salad outlets, 'wichcraft. In 2010 his work at Craft was honored when the Beard Foundation named him the country's Outstanding Chef.

No other writer working today can claim as long a professional association with James Beard. Their association began when she was hired to supervise and write much of The Cook's Catalogue, a book edited by Beard with Milton Glaser and Burton Richard Wolf in 1975. She continued to work with him, teaching classes at his cooking schools in California and New York, and helping him with his writing. After Beard's death, she put together The James Beard's Celebration Cookbook in order to raise money for the James Beard Foundation. Kafka's own exhaustively-researched single-subject cookbooks (Vegetables, Roasting, Microwave Cooking) have set a standard for excellence. In 2007, Kafka received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the James Beard Foundation.

That friendship took Ferrone beyond his already illustrious list of authors—Anais Nin, Alice Walker, Eudora Welty, C.S. Lewis, Janet Flanner—into the world of food. Working at night after he finished his day job, Ferrone began, out of a devotion to the friendship, editing scores of Beard's articles. Eventually he worked on some of Beard's books and continued to do so (as Beard's literary executor) after his death. The books include: the James Beard Cookbook, the Armchair James Beard, and several small format books, including: Soups and Stews and Poultry and Shellfish. Ferrone continues to steward Beard's books and attempt keep them in print. Ferrone discusses not only he and Beard's friendship and their work together, but also others in Beard's circle. He also speaks of their many meals together. A list of those meals, compiled by Ferrone, is included in this file.

She had been inadvertently caught up in Operation Suzannah, a 1954 plot to undermine international support for Egypt as a reliable administrator of the Suez Canal. When the operation failed, it morphed into a political quagmire known as the Lavon Affair. Because Carmel, then a young soldier working in the Finance Ministry, had, under orders, altered a document related to the affair, she unhappily became a public figure. Carmel discusses the Lavon Affair; her eventual decision to leave Israel, first for London and eventually—she thought temporarily—for the United States; the gradual development of her cookbook collection, and her decision to donate the volumes to the Fales Library.","El al, netive ayir le-Yiśrael (El Al Israel Airlines); Fales Library; Yad va-shem, rashut ha-zikaron la0Shoah vela-gevurah (Yad Vashem, Jerusalem)","Lavon, Pinchas; Nestle, Marion; Pachter, Mina; Eshkol, Levi, 1895-1969; Ben-Gurion, David, 1886-1973; Brown, Bianca; Carmel, Dalia; De Silva, Cara; Avigur, Shaoul; Peer, Edith; Stern, Annie; Taub, Judith; Taylor, Marvin J.; Kieshenblatt-Gimblett, Barbara; Hausner, Gideon, 1915-1990; Goldstein, Herbert; Gibli, Binyamin","Book collecting; Cookbooks; Cooking, American -- History -- 20th century; Cooking, Jewish -- History -- 20th century; Concentration camp inmates' writings; Dinners and dining; Entertaining; Gastronomy; International cooking; Israel -- Politics and government -- 1948-1967; Publishers and publishing","New York University, Fales Library and Special Collections","Carmel, Dalia.

In her 1999, The Story of Corn: the Myths and History, the Culture and Agriculture, the Art and Science of America's Quintessential Crop, Fussel used the history of corn to tell a distinctly American story. She also created a genre, now much imitated by other writers, focused on a single foodstuff. Born in 1927 in California and reared there, she has made her home in New York's Greenwich Village for decades. She lives around the corner from James Beard's cooking school run out of his home. Her only contact was a week's worth of classes there, but they share an abiding passion for American food. Her essays in literary journals, major newspapers, national magazines and encyclopedias are written with a grace few food writers can match. She also lectures at museums, universities, state fairs, corn festivals, historical societies and culinary groups. In 1999, her food memoir, My Kitchen Wars, traced her life from her childhoood through her marriage to a college sweetheart, her travails as an academic wife, her own academic career, the women's movement, and her wider success when she found her essential subject: food.

The book demystified Indian food and in a way, was a reflection of her own introduction to Indian cooking, once she left New Delhi to pursue an acting career in England and America. Like many upper class Indian women, Jaffrey hadn't learned to cook as a child. Once she left home, she longed for the food of her childhood. Letters from her mother as well as Jaffrey's own strong sense of taste set her on her way. A well-known Indian actress, Jaffrey was at home in front of cameras and. As her food writing career developed, that experience made her a natural for television. Since that first cookbook—then praised by New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne as ""perhaps the best Indian cookbook available in English""—she has written 28 more, many of them in tandem with multiple television series both in the United States and the UK. She has also written countless newspaper and magazine articles, and continued a much-praised acting career. Both of those threads of her life are discussed in this interview.","Alfred A.
